## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-Server Model**: Confirmed as appropriate for multiplayer game
- **Ebiten Framework**: Valid choice for cross-platform 2D gaming
- **JSON Persistence**: Suitable for current scale, consider database for growth
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Correct for real-time multiplayer features

### Development Decisions
- **Memory Bank System**: Essential for maintaining project knowledge
- **Go Workspace**: Appropriate for multi-module project structure
- **Single Developer Workflow**: Focus on maintainable, well-documented code
- **Cross-Platform Priority**: Desktop and mobile equally important

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance Targets**: 60 FPS on mobile devices is ambitious but achievable
- **Network Latency**: Must handle 100-500ms conditions gracefully
- **Memory Constraints**: < 500MB RAM limit on mobile requires optimization
- **Asset Management**: Current PNG-based system works, consider optimization

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Package Structure**: Clear separation of concerns (game, ui, net, etc.)
- **Interface Design**: Use interfaces for testable, modular components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with proper logging
- **Concurrency**: Careful use of goroutines for network and background tasks

### Development Practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and memory bank updates
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical business logic
- **Version Control**: Clear commit messages and feature branches
- **Code Review**: Self-review for consistency and best practices

### Game Design Patterns
- **Component Architecture**: Modular UI and game systems
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven state updates
- **Command Pattern**: Reversible battle actions
- **Factory Pattern**: Unit and asset creation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
- **Ebiten Maturity**: Excellent for 2D games with good mobile support
- **Go Performance**: Well-suited for game development with good concurrency
- **WebSocket Complexity**: Real-time networking requires careful state management
- **Cross-Platform Challenges**: Input handling and UI scaling need attention

### Project Management Insights
- **Documentation Importance**: Memory bank system prevents knowledge loss
- **Incremental Development**: MVP-focused approach reduces risk
- **Single Developer Efficiency**: Clear priorities and focused scope essential
- **User Experience Focus**: Game feel as important as technical features

### Architecture Insights
- **Client-Server Benefits**: Enables persistent worlds and fair multiplayer
- **State Synchronization**: Critical for multiplayer game consistency
- **Asset Organization**: Structured approach scales well
- **Protocol Design**: Shared types prevent client-server mismatches

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Mobile Performance**: Achieving 60 FPS with complex battle scenes
- **Network Reliability**: Handling disconnections and state reconciliation
- **UI Responsiveness**: Touch controls and varying screen sizes
- **Memory Management**: Optimizing for mobile RAM constraints

### Development Challenges
- **Feature Scope**: Balancing ambition with single-developer capacity
- **Testing Complexity**: Multiplayer features require careful testing
- **Platform Differences**: Ensuring consistent experience across platforms
- **Asset Creation**: Time-intensive process for game art and balance

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Mobile Performance**: Could require significant optimization work
