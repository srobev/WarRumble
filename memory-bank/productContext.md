# WarRumble Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

WarRumble addresses the growing demand for accessible, strategic multiplayer gaming experiences that combine tactical depth with social interaction. In an era of fast-paced mobile games, there's a gap for thoughtful strategy games that reward planning and execution while fostering community engagement.
